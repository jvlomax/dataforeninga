To run
=============
The program uses a virtual enviroment, no setup needed. 

To run a program within the virtual enviroment use the python.exe in the venv/Scripts directory.
If you use pycahrm or another any other IDE, direct it to use the python.exe file provided (pycharm should identify it quite easily).

If you need to work within the virtual enviroment, run activate in the venv/Scripts directory
- activate <- Mac and Linux
- activate.bar <- windows command line
- activte.ps1 <- windows powershell


If you have no idea what any of the above means, just open the terminal in the root directory of the project and type `venv/Scripts/python.exe main.py` and navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000
