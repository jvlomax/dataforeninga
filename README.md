To run
=============
The program uses a virtual enviroment, no setup needed. 

To run a program within the virtual enviroment use the python.exe in the venv/Scripts directory.
If you use pycahrm or another any other IDE, direct it to use the python.exe file provided (pycharm should identify it quite easily).

If you need to work within the virtual enviroment, run activate in the venv/Scripts directory
- activate <- Mac and Linux
- activate.bar <- windows command line
- activte.ps1 <- windows powershell
